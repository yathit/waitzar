/*
 * Regression tests for the Zawgyi-One keyboard. Run on the command line with:
 * WaitZar.exe -t zawgyi_tests.txt
 * Note: These tests are based on the Zawgyi2009 keyboard layout, found on:
 * http://code.google.com/p/zawgyi-keyboard/
 * There is a newer Zawgyi layout provided by Planet Myanmar, but it differs strongly
 *       from what Zawgyi users would expect.
 * The following options help WZ initialize the testing environment. 
     @language = myanmar
     @input-method = zawgyikbd
     @output-encoding = unicode
