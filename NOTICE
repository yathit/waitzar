The Zawgyi-One Font: Version 3.14
 Zawgyi-One is a curious font; its copyright belongs to Zawgyi.net and Alpha Mandalay.
 However, it is distributed with no licensing information, and is thus classified and 
 redistributable under the terms of license-free software. The Zawgyi.net website has
 stated in a front-page article that Zawgyi-One is and will always be free. 
 The Wait Zar project sees fonts like Zawgyi-One as an enabling technology, and sees no 
 legal need to request special permission to embed or redistribute such fonts, so long
 as credit is duly given and links to the latest versions of such fonts are provided.
 We would encourage members of the Alpha Myanmar team to contact us directly if they
 have any questions or requests.

The Padauk Font: Version 2.4
 Padauk is available from SIL International and Than Lwin Soft under the Open Font License;
 a copy of which has been embedded at the end of the LICENSE file.
Note that WaitZar's rendering order of letters (in "Help" mode) may appear similar to that of 
 Padauk's. Our algorithm is based slightly on Padauk's ligature substitution rules, although our
 behaviour differs subtly and is unique to WaitZar. Should you consider this to be a "derivative work",
 please note that we choose to license this algorithm under the Apache license like the rest of the project. 
 This is in conformance with the Open Font License.

The Hyperlink Files
 The files Hyperlinks.[cpp|h] have been retrieved from CodeGurus; the CodeGurus license is a
 bit vague, but they state:
 "While we are talking about copyrights, you retain copyright of your article and code, but by submitting 
 it to CodeGuru you give permission to use it in a fair manner and also permit all developers to freely use 
 the code in their own applications -even if they are commercial."
 ...thus, we choose to include the Hyperlinks code in our project.

The myWin Myanmar Unicode keyboard layout, version 2.2
 The files:
 - myWin2.2.kmn (in a derivative form)
 The myWin Unicode keyboard was designed as a Unicode 5.1-compliant re-visioning of the 
 popular Win Burmese font layouts. It was considered a good candidate for WaitZar, as it 
 is explicitly recommended for both Windows and Linux input of Myanmar text. This layout
 is not used in its original format; rather, it is refactored into the "Help" menu (F1)
 to allow users to perform a reverse-lookup of Burmese words in the WaitZar dictionary.
 As per the license, we are re-licensing this derivative work under the GPL version 3.0

The Crypto++ Library, version 5.60
 The files:
 - *.h, *.cpp in Contrib/CryptoPP
 The Crypto++ library provides an excellent implementation of various hashing algorithms and cryptographic
 algorithms in C++. All files are released under the public domain, while the library itself has a separate license.
 We only include the files needed for the MD5 algorithm.
