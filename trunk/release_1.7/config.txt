# The hotkey is defined as:
#    [modifier] letter
# Modifiers include: ! for alt, ^ for control, and + for shift
# The letter can be any of the modifiers, and any letter. 
# Space is represented by an underscore _
# The final character is the letter; all preceeding characters
# are condidered modifiers (e.g., !+ implies "Hold Alt and Press Shift")
# Some examples:
#    ^m     "Control + m"
#    ^!_    "Control+Alt + Space"
#    !+    "Alt + Shift" 
#NO_LINUX: This option does not work under Linux (set the hotkey from the SCIM control panel)

# If "no", a warning box will not display when using

# If "yes", each typed word becomes part of a phrase; the user
#  must type "Space" again to enter the entire phrase. The benefit of doing it this way is 
#  that Wait Zar can "figure out" what word you want based on the previous words.
# Also, you can use the arrow keys to move left/right between words, like a mini text editor.

# If "yes", WaitZar will detect if it is running on Vista, un-elevated, and will
