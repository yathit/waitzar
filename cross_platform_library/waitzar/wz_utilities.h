// Please note that the wz_utilities library is currently considered
//   to be UNSTABLE, and is not included in the Linux build by default.
// This is because most of its functionality is of direct benefit to the
//   Windows build, so we hope to test its correctness through the next
//   two Windows releases of WaitZar. 
// Since there is some universally-useful code here, we will eventually
//   include this in both releases, but we want to avoid bumping libwaitzar's
//   major revision for breakages caused by code that wasn't originally intended
//   for Linux to begin with.
